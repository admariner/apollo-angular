# Automatic Persisted Queries

Unlike REST APIs that use a fixed URL to load data, GraphQL provides a rich query language that can
be used to express the shape of application data requirements. This is a marvelous advancement in
technology, but it comes at a cost: GraphQL query strings are often much longer than REST urls â€” in
some cases by many kilobytes.

In practice, we've seen GraphQL query sizes ranging well above 10 KB just for the query text. This
is significant overhead when compared with a simple URL of 50-100 characters. When paired with the
fact that the uplink speed from the client is typically the most bandwidth-constrained part of the
chain, large queries can become bottlenecks for client performance.

Automatic Persisted Queries solves this problem by sending a generated ID instead of the query text
as the request.

## How It Works

1. When the client makes a query, it will optimistically send a short (64-byte) cryptographic hash
   instead of the full query text.
2. If the backend recognizes the hash, it will retrieve the full text of the query and execute it.
3. If the backend doesn't recognize the hash, it will ask the client to send the hash and the query
   text to it can store them mapped together for future lookups. During this request, the backend
   will also fulfill the data request.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i apollo-angular
```

If you do not already have an SHA-256 based hashing function available in your application, you will
need to install one separately. For example:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i crypto-hash
```

This link doesn't include an SHA-256 hash function by default, to avoid forcing one as a dependency.
Developers should pick the most appropriate SHA-256 function (sync or async) for their
needs/environment.

## Usage

Use `createPersistedQueryLink` function and put it before `HttpLink` in the link chain.

```ts filename="app.config.ts"
import { provideApollo } from 'apollo-angular';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-angular/http';
import { createPersistedQueryLink } from 'apollo-angular/persisted-queries';
import { sha256 } from 'crypto-hash';
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

provideApollo(() => {
  const httpLink = inject(HttpLink);

  return {
    link: createPersistedQueryLink({ sha256 }).concat(httpLink.create({ uri: '/graphql' })),
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    // other options ...
  };
});
```

That's it! Now your client will start sending query signatures instead of the full text resulting in
improved network performance.

## More

This library is just a simple wrapper of
[`@apollo/client/link/persisted-queries`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/main/src/link/persisted-queries)
to make it work in Angular with `apollo-angular/http` (also with batch link). Thanks to that you can
use any options, any functionality that the original package provides.
