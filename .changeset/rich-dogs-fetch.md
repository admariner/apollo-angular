'apollo-angular': patch

New repository owners

[@kamilkisiela](https://github.com/kamilkisiela), the creator of this library, has found new
interests and is not able to contribute like in the past. He gracefully transferred ownership of the
repository to me. I have been maintaining this library since 2022, and will continue doing so in the
foreseeable future.

For the package consumers, pretty much nothing will change. The package name, the code, the relation
with [The Guild](https://github.com/the-guild-org), and the maintenance style will all remain the
same. The only difference is the new repository URL: https://github.com/the-guild-org/apollo-angular.
